# Palm Tree Leaf Disease Detection App

**Palm Tree Leaf Disease Detection App** is designed to assist in the identification and management of diseases affecting palm tree leaves. By utilizing advanced image analysis techniques, the app can detect and classify common leaf diseases, providing valuable insights and recommended treatments.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of palm tree leaves directly from their devices.
- **Disease Detection**: The app analyzes the uploaded images to identify signs of various leaf diseases, such as brown spots, leaf blight, and other common conditions.
- **Classification**: Detected diseases are classified into specific categories, providing a clear diagnosis.
- **Treatment Recommendations**: For each identified disease, the app suggests appropriate treatments, including the use of fungicides or other management practices.
